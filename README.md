## Genie Framework example library

This repo contains short examples for Genie apps that showcase a single feature or use case. To run them, install the `GenieFramework` package, open a Julia REPL in the code directory, and execute with `include(example-name.jl)`.

These examples are shown in the [Genie Cloud Resource Center](https://learn.geniecloud.io). The `build_docs.jl` script generates the .md files for the site using `Literate.jl`.
